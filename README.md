# GhostDocPatcher
replace the exe in GhostDocInstallDir:
 for VS17 extension version it's located in:
C:\Users\<USERNAME>\AppData\Local\Microsoft\VisualStudio\15.0_c2f3c461\Extensions\5igvqwcc.q5g

@ Run Patcher as admin in any directory !

Just hard set the folder to that location, run patcher and go.

I installed only "GhostDoc Pro.v5.9.18070.VS2017.Extension.vsix" file and the patch it's for Visual Studio 2017 Ent. on Windows 10 x64 Ent.
